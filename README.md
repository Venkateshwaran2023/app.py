🩺 PCOSNet: AI for PCOS Detection

PCOSNet is an AI-powered diagnostic assistant that combines ultrasound imaging and tabular clinical data (age, BMI, symptoms, lab values) to assist in detecting Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).

This project is the first step toward building an AI healthcare startup that empowers women with early diagnosis and awareness tools.

🚀 Features (Current Progress)

✅ Demo Streamlit App: Try PCOS risk prediction using tabular features.

✅ Form-based input: Enter age, BMI, cycle length, and symptoms.

✅ Instant prediction output (prototype model).

🔜 Ultrasound image classification module (coming soon).

🔜 Fusion model: Combine tabular + image data for higher accuracy.

🔜 Clinical validation with real-world datasets.
